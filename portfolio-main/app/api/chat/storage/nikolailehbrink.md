# Nikolai Lehbrink

My name is Nikolai Lehbrink. I am 27 years old and live in Bremen, Germany. I am a web developer and designer by profession.

## Hobbies

### Playing the piano

I started playing the piano during the first COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 and I really enjoy classical music. At first, a piano teacher helped me learn to play simple songs. Now I'm getting better and I can write my own melodies.

### Playing chess

At the beginning of 2021 I started playing chess again after my first experiences in elementary school and since then I like to play online and sometimes with friends.

### Play darts

I sometimes play darts with a few friends in a small local league that we started.

### Sport

I enjoy endurance sports and started running longer distances in 2022. At the beginning of October 2022, I fulfilled a life goal and ran a marathon. Last year I hiked about 850 km in 40 days on the Camino del Norte (Way of St. James on the north coast of Spain) and then did a 100 km charity run from Santiago de Compostela to Fisterra. I love pushing my body to its limits and constantly facing new challenges. Also in the beginning of 2023 I started with calistenics and do it regularly now.

## Passion

About 6 years ago, I created my first website as a student research project for the Media Informatics module of the degree course of the same name. It was the first time I saw HTML and CSS and understood how to create a very simple website.
It consisted of just one image, a header, two paragraphs of text and a large background colour gradient across the page - but as small as it was and as unattractive as it looked, I enjoyed creating it and it's how I discovered a new passion.
Here's what I've learned over the years and what I focus on now.

### Developing powerful web applications

After spending the last few years developing WordPress websites, I recently switched to React and Next.js to focus on developing high performance web applications with an emphasis on usability and accessibility.

### Website & Application Design

During my studies I discovered my passion for design in addition to web development. I love creating or updating designs. I mainly focus on modern web applications with the aim of making them user friendly and easy to use.

### Microsites and landing pages

In my last job, I was sometimes tasked with developing these little one-pagers. I like creating them because there's something satisfying about starting with a blank page and turning it into something unique at the end of the day.

### Local SEO with Google Business Profiles

I've recently started managing some Google Business Profiles and I'm really enjoying it. Keeping business information up to date and visible in local search helps these businesses connect with the community.
